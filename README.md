# EchoMaze

EchoMaze is a game created for the Moroccan Game Jam 2025.  
It is built using the Stride Game Engine.

## About the Game

EchoMaze is a sound-driven exploration game where you control a small bat navigating through dark underground spaces. Vision is extremely limited, so you must rely on your EchoPower to briefly reveal the environment. By listening carefully and following the sounds around you, you can find the correct path and reach your goal.

The game is fully designed around the jam theme "Echo" and focuses on sound-based guidance, atmosphere, and minimal visibility.
